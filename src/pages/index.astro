				<p>hi!! i'm htrowii, student in singapore! i am currently studying information technology :D</p>
				<p>this is my <del>1st</del> <del>2nd</del> <del>3rd</del> 4th attempt at creating a website... i felt like my past ones were either not really good or didn't quite represent <span class="bold italic">me</span> as a person, but that's a pretty hard thing to capture lol</p>
				<p>who knows ... maybe i'll make a 5th in the future. actually that is the most likely option when i inevitably feel unsatisfied again D:</p>

                    <li>i am / was jailbroke my phones!! i really enjoyed doing so in the past when i had like way too much time ... but from that i learned how to rice my own devices which I still continue to doooo hehe you can check some out hereeee !! it's mainly macOS / linux which i still bother doing now - windows and android i don't really use / find too hard to configure D:<FancyHyperlink href="/rices/" content="here"></li>
