				<p>this is my <del>1st</del> <del>2nd</del> <del>3rd</del> 4th attempt at creating a website... i felt like my past ones were either not really good or didn't quite represent <span class="bold italic">me</span> as a person, but that's a pretty hard thing to capture lol</p>
				<p>who knows ... maybe i'll make a 5th in the future. actually that is the most likely option when i inevitably feel unsatisfied again D:</p>
